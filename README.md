# Contoso Traders - Cloud testing tools demo app

> [!WARNING]  
> The content of this repository is based on [contosotraders-cloudtesting](https://github.com/microsoft/contosotraders-cloudtesting) and has been modified to focus its instructions in Github and Azure Chaos Studio experiments.

The Contoso Traders app is a sample application showcasing [Azure Load Testing](https://aka.ms/malt-docs), [Azure Chaos Studio](https://aka.ms/CHAOS-docs) and more.

This repo contains the source code, deployment templates, and demo scripts for exploring these cloud testing tools.
